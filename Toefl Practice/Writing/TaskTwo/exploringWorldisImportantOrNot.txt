We have 7 billion people in numbers on the earth, and numerous things that happening at the same time. So, even though exploring the world has a little affection of our daily lives, there still some reasons that we should know about what are happening all around the world.

First, we could widen our version during looking at the world news. Building a fine version could help you making some better decisions. For example, if you want to learn something about the newest technology about computer science, you could search on the Internet and found out what kind of technology development are most fashion on the world. If you just concentrate in this area in your country or hometown, you probably could not realize that there are already some robots in our real lives.

Second, it helps with us a lot for building knowledge system. As I mentioned, there are 7 billion people live on the same world with us, therefore, there are lots kinds of human culture. Some of these culture have a quite long history and there are still some miseries that unknown. We could learn experiences from any other countries and there must be some thing useful for you.

In addition, through global social media we could enlarge our social circle. Today, we could get connected in a very easy way, Internet. If you want to learn French, you don't need to fly to Paris, just using Facebook and find some one native, you could talk about something happening in France or your travel plan to France.

From my view, there are so many benefits that to get understand others on the planet.
