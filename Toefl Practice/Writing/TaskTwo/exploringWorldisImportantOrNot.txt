Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
It is important to know about events happening around the world, even if it is unlikely that they will affect your daily life.

We have 7 billion people in numbers on the earth, and numerous things that are happening at the same time. So, even though exploring the world has a little effect of our daily lives, there are still some reasons that we should know about what is happening all around the world.

First, we could widen our version while looking at the world news. Building a fine version could help you make some better decisions. For example, if you want to learn something about the newest technology about computer science, you could search on the Internet and find out what kind of technology development are most fashionable in the world. If you just concentrate on this area in your country or hometown, you probably could not realize that there are already some robots in our real lives.

Second, it helps us a lot for building knowledge system. As I mentioned, there are 7 billion people live in the same world with us, therefore, there are lots of kinds of human culture. Some of these culture have quite a long history and there are still some mysteries that to be explored. We could learn experiences from any other countries and there must be some thing useful for you.

In addition, through global social media we could enlarge our social circle. Today, we could get connected in a very easy way, Internet. If you want to learn French, you don't need to fly to Paris, just using Facebook and find some one native speaker, you could talk about something happening in France or your travel plan to France.

From my view, there are so many benefits that to get understand others on the planet.
