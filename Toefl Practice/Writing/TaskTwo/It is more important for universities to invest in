It is more important for universities to invest in infrastructure and physical plant than to invest in keeping the faculty satisfied. 

As development of modern education, more and more people are going to get a high degree than before and universities give more admission to young people. There is a hot debate based on whether universities should invest more in fundamental facilities or invest in satisfying of the faculty. From my view, it is more meaningful to invest in keeping faculty satisfied than spend money in fundamental facilities.
First of all, invest in enhancing satisfying could improve the teaching quality of universities. People pay more attention to the quality of each university, it directly decides the rank of universities. One of the crucial factor that effects education quality of an university is faculty. It hard to image that if one university's faculty who do not satisfy with his or her work could perform wonderful in classes everyday. For example, my sister is a primary school math teacher, once she asked for improve 
In addition, faulty satisfying effects reputation of universities.
We have to admit the fact that investing of infrastructure and physical plant can improve the reputation of universities, but compared to  the long-term advantages of invest in soft power, it is worthier.
As far as I can concern, even though invest infrastructure and physical plant have some advantages, but it brings more benefits if using money on faculty.
