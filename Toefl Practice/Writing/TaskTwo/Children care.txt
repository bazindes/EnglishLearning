With the progressing of our society, people becoming more and more busier today. According to socialists, there are a growing number of parents who looking for child-care services. Some of them prefer to send children to child-care center where many children are cared together, some of them choose individual caregiver. From my opinion, the children-center is better place for children to go.

First of all, children center can provide a social environment for children to grow up which individual caregiver do not have. Child in children center could grow up with many friends who probably will be his or her life time friends. Further more, according to recent children researchers' report, children who grow up with many friends are more successful than those children grow up individually in their future studying.

Second, children center is less expensive than individual caregiver in general. Parents can use the money on any other things that are good for children, such as buying them toys and taking them to travel. My uncle Lee, for example, he promised my little brother Peter that he will take him to a world trip. And then, Lee started to save money, after three years he took Peter to a world travel when he was 8 years old. Peter always talked about the wanderful trip and how much he learned from other countries with me. However, if my uncle choose the more expensive individual caregiver, maybe Peter's world trip can never come true.

Admittedly, I concede that individual caregiver can provide more individual caring for each child. Nevertheless, it is not worthy that giving child an alone environment without any friends. According to socialists, people who grow up with a lot of friends are less likely becoming a crimer than those people who grow up alone. 

In conclude, individual caregiver might have some good aspect for chhildren, however, the children center is more worthy because of the good environment and less expensive.
