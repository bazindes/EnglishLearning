综合写作：
1.      综合写作文章快速看完写出三点，关键是在每一点后面做听力部分的笔记，听力是重点
2.      时态在没有特殊要求的时候可以全部用一般现在，保持全篇一致最重要
3.      综合写作每一分段内先passage再lecture，最后一段可以先lecture再passage，一方面可以增加diversity，不过主要是确保听力内容不遗漏，如果时间充足，可以全篇都先passage再lecture (2:1)
4.      不能照抄阅读内容，概括能力很重要
Point out/state/indicate/argue/claim/suggest/hold the idea/maintain
Doubt/offer alternative explanation/challenge/cast doubt about/oppose/refute/contend
It is highly possible/can be/may
独立写作：
独立写作最好按照首段主题句->段落中心句->开头引入->段落论证内容->结尾总结的顺序写，便于考场上理清思路。
1.      观点展开的方法在于例证、解释、细节，关联词非常重要
2.      避免使用绝对词（all, none），避免使用模糊名词（thing / people->item, product, commodity, issue, phenomenon, event, idea, consequence, result / students, professionals, scholars, citizens, local residents, each individual），避免使用模糊形容词（good / bad）
3.      头脑风暴
(1)    拆分名词（people->students, businessmen, old people/information->news, educational information, daily information, entertainment），拆分时间（in early childhood, in adolescence, in adulthood），拆分地点（at home, in school, at workplace），拆分成功失败（success, making progress / failure, making mistakes）
(2)    个人万能理由（less expensive, save time, efficient, safe / discover one interest, broaden  horizon, expand knowledge, develop ability, cooperative, strengthen family relationships, sense of accomplishment ），社会万能理由（improved living standards, technological advancement, environmental protection, educational opportunities, community services），个人和社会万能理由——先找最贴合主题的个性化理由，再使用“万能理由”扩充
4.      谋篇布局
(1)    一边倒结构
(2)    让步转折结构（题目含有绝对词时，往往第一段让步之后再转折；不含绝对词时，转折可以在前也可以在后。不过观点一定要清晰）
(3)    折中结构
5.      段落中心句（简洁表达观点，用好词、词组、句型进行修饰）
--Always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship between people.
First and foremost, in order to maintain a close relationship between lovers, it is necessary to tell white lies in some occasions.

Second, there is much evidence to suggest that white lies are acceptable between parents and children under some special circumstances.

Finally, white lies are helpful in building patient’s confidence when they fight against diseases, especially against some fatal diseases.

--It is better to work in a large company than in a small one
Admittedly, a small company offers much work flexibility and intimate friendship.

However, the benefits of working for a small company are outweighed by those of working for a large company that provides more compensation and social welfare benefits.

Moreover, each individual is able to receive more training and promotion opportunities when working in a large company.
6.      开头段：背景介绍（调查数据，引用名言也可）->引入话题（先提出想法观点再驳斥也可）->主题句（直接归纳分论点或者笼统的说3 reasons, 让步转折结构的文章推荐前一种方法）
7.      例证法
(1)    例子来源多样，可以是知识也可以是自身经验
(2)    例子具体
The earth provides human beings with what we need, but natural resources are not limited. Stripping mining destroys most regions and leaves bare and useless ground. Deforestation removes old trees that cannot be easily replaced. Also, over-fishing may harm fish population to the extent difficult to recover.
(3)    单例子法（名人、个人经历，详细描述）、多例子法（不须提前准备，只要有侧重的概括就行）、微例子法（air and water pollution caused by industrial wastes, global warming, acid rain, land depletion, rainforest destruction / watching appealing movies, going to parks, having a delicious meal at a first-rate restaurant, taking along journey to appreciate the beauty of nature）
(4)    类比法（is like, resemble, is similar to），分类法（Maslow’sHierarchy of Needs Theory, physiological needs, safety needs, esteem needs, self-actualization/the needs to fulfill oneself），数例法（According to a recent study/research/survey conducted by ministry of education of China/Harvard University, …% of the respondents acknowledged that…）
8.      因果法：论点->原因->条件->结论
9.      对比法：有无对比，今昔对比（In contrast, However, On the contrary, Contradictorily, In comparison）
10.  结尾段：采用让步转折结构（it might be true that / there is sufficient evidence to prove that, there is enough evidence to justify my point that, judging from all the situations mentioned above, we may reach the conclusion that）
First/firstly/initially/in the first place/first of all/to begin with/to start with
Second/secondly/in the second place/besides/furthermore/moreover/in addition/additionally
Third/thirdly/finally/lastly
Primarily/Moreover/Admittedly/On contrast
However/nevertheless/nonetheless/alternatively
A small leak will sink a great ship.
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
