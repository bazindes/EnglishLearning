Is social media making us more self- centered?

It depends, sometimes it really does, but sometimes it brings more advantages I thought.

At first, I want to talk about the good things. Social media makes me a social poeple, because when I was a little boy, I used to be shy and afraid to talk with other children. And I remember that when I grow up and go to college, I found that everybody was very polite and always had a smiling face, they talked with each other just like old friends. From that time, I reliazed that I need to open my mouth and heart to others and I started with one of most popular social media in China, RenRen Wang, it looks like Facebook. Though the Internet, I found that I am not be shy to say hello to a fresh man any more. So, I build a social circle quickly and now I have more than 300 friends on Internet, some of them has same intersts with me and some of them we always played basketball together. 

On the other hand, social media makes people more and more self-centered, especially among the youth. People called this phenomenon narcissism. In my view, there two reasons. First one is that lots of people use social meidia, like Facebook, to post a lot of selfies, especially young girls. Sometimes they even spand very long time to make up before they post it because they don't want others see them are not beautiful enough. Second is that it is very easy to post one's opinion on Internet platform. Once you send a message which other people might have same feeling as yours, they might give you a thumbs up which makes you thought you are doing right things. But it's hard to say that if there are somebody support you because you are absolutely right.
